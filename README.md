## Contributing
If you want to help improve the game's TASes, reach out to me on Discord! All you need to do is to improve a relevent single-level TAS file and send it to me, then I'll verify it and add it to the repository. The best spot to do this is in `#project-wip` in [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/JxXxKAPKwT).

The TAS files in this repository are often incomplete or just here to preserve them for future use. You're welcome to help finish drafting or to improve these files, but to contributing to the main projects (Any%, 100%, etc), check out the files in the [Main Category repository](https://github.com/MGR-tas/NsmbwTAS-Files) instead.

If you TAS a level that might be useful later, send it to me and I'll add it to this repository.
